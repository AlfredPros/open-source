# Alfred Kuhlman (AlfredPros)

_Hi!_ My name is [Alfred Kuhlman](https://github.com/AlfredPros)! You can call me "Alfred"! :D

I like software engineering because I can create things that's on my mind into reality! And seeing my creation come to life is **very** satisfying!

And my favorite food? That has to be ramen / noodle!
